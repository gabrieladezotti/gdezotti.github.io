  <h1>Gabriela Dezotti</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Gabriela :)</p>
<p>I’m currently working as a TT-IV technical funded by 
FAPESP at the Lab of Vegetation Ecology <a href="https://levegunesp.wixsite.com/leveg" target="_blank">(LEVeg)</a>
at São Paulo State University (UNESP, Rio Claro).</p>
<p>Here, you’ll find a bit about what I'm researching and a few other things I like to talk about.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of <strong>forbs</strong>. 
<p>I’ve also gotten pretty into working with data.</p>
<p>Since undergrad, I’ve been messing around with datasets, and at some point, I became a full-on data nerd.
Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into topics like data management and organization,
and I’m all in on spreading the word about FAIR principles in science.</p>
<p>So in the end, my work ends up blending two things I love: open ecosystems 
(with a special place in my heart for forbs!) and 
data — from visualizing it to keeping it tidy and shareable.</p>
