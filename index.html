  <h1>Gabriela Dezotti</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Gabriela :)
I’m currently working as a TT-IV technical fellow funded by FAPESP at the Lab of Vegetation Ecology <a href="https://levegunesp.wixsite.com/leveg" target="_blank">(LEVeg)</a> at São Paulo State University (UNESP, Rio Claro).
Here, you’ll find a bit about what I'm researching and a few other things I care about.

I’m a big fan of forbs. Over time, I’ve also gotten pretty into working with data. 
    Since undergrad, I’ve been messing around with datasets, and at some point, I became a full-on data nerd. 
    Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into topics like data management and organization, and I’m all in on spreading the word about FAIR principles in science.

So in the end, my work ends up blending two things I love: open ecosystems (with a special place in my heart for forbs!) and data — from visualizing it to keeping it tidy and shareable..</p>
